Qspice #4: Frequency Response Analysis of DC-DC Converters

This video shows how to use Qspice to obtain the frequency response of a DC-DC converter. An example is given for the buck converter obtaining the control-to-output transfer function and the input impedance, output impedance, and audiosusceptibility transfer functions. The methodology presented in the video can be used to obtain the frequency response of any other system.
